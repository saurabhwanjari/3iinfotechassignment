--input: you can take any type of input for better understandin in take even in one file and odd number in another file 

--how to run ?
        you run it on any platform 
        you need mingw version of gcc version above 11 for mutex 
        I prefer you to use linux platform for better result but it is to hard to get result simulating both are running at a same time
